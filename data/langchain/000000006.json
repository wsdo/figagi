We’re lucky to have a community of so many passionate developers building with LangChain–we have so much to teach and learn from each other. Community members contribute code, host meetups, write blog posts, amplify each other’s work, become each other's customers and collaborators, and so much more.\n\nWhether you’re new to LangChain, looking to go deeper, or just want to get more exposure to the world of building with LLMs, this page can point you in the right direction.\n\n🦜 Contribute to LangChain\n\n🌍 Meetups, Events, and Hackathons\n\n📣 Help Us Amplify Your Work\n\n💬 Stay in the loop\n\n🦜 Contribute to LangChain\n\nLangChain is the product of over 5,000+ contributions by 1,500+ contributors, and there is **still** so much to do together.
